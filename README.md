# PLAID - the GridPane Stack ![CI status](https://img.shields.io/badge/build-passing-brightgreen.svg)

Optimized LEMP Web Server - Based on Webinoly

This is mostly a non-interactive build/install of the Webinoly stack with customizations specific to the GridPane platform. 

This is currently not meant for "outside consumption" or use with systems other than GridPane.com provisioned VPS nodes. (Though it certainly could be - but you're on your own and YMMV!)

The PLAID stack provides a set of tools and commands that facilitate GridPane powered web server administration.
- Unique commands to create, delete, disable sites.
- Free SSL certificates for your sites with Letâ€™s Encrypt and automatic server configuration.
- HTTP/2 dramatically increase the speed of serving your content.
- PHP v7.2 and support for previous versions if necessary (5.6, 7.0 and 7.1).
- FastCgi Cache and Redis Object Cache for your WordPress sites.
- Get an A+ grade on [Qualys (SSL Labs) Test](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/).
- Log viewer in real time.
